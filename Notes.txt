			**********Problems Ecountered and Solution********************

Depandabot in git authomatically updated the versions of the requirement.txt upto date and thsi cause my cone to malfunction. It took me a while to realise the error and dissable the option for auto update of my requirements files 

I used a software called XAMPP to connect my databases while working remotely(offline) but it was very difficult for me to edit the code use another software when the website was hosted to a free hosting provider

It was also difficult finding a hosting provider to host my python code and first instance. It was after a throrough search that I can to know about pythoneverywhere.
